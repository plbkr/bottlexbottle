When we first started making them, we didn’t pay much attention to the details, but as time went on, we realized that the little things make a big difference.{break}{break}Firstly, as this is the drink of the American south, you’ll want to use bourbon as your spirit. This is a fairly spirit-forward drink, so you’ll want to use a bourbon that you’d be comfortable drinking straight. We used Corner Creek in this recipe but Woodford Reserve is beautiful if you can get it at a good price. We also used a minted simple syrup to help bring out the mint flavours. Crushed ice is essential to a good Julep, and if you have a metal cup we recommend that too. Both things help to melt your ice faster, which is actually what you want, as the julep starts off quite spirit forward and then gets slowly more watered-down (and more refreshing) as you drink it.

Tiki cocktails are usually made with rum but often with split bases; a mixture of aged and white rum is common. Tiki drinks are often served in special tiki mugs with a number of garnishes.{break}{break}The Mai Tai is considered by many to be the quintessential tiki drink. The invention of the drink is a contentious issue; both of the men considered to be the founders of the tiki movement, Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber, claim to have come up with the Mai Tai.{break}{break}Tiki drinks tend to be fairly sweet and usually have lots of citrus, making them fairly easy-drinking summer cocktails. They often also contain overproof rums so that the booze cuts through the other flavours. The Mai Tai uses lime juice as the acid and almond-flavoured orgeat syrup as the sweetener, with curaçao adding sweetness and subtle orange flavour. While we recommend triple sec for most of our cocktails, the Mai Tai is one where a sweeter curaçao is also quite nice.",
